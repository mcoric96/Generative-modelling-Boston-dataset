## Theory
Gaussian mixture models (GMM) are probabilistic statistical models usedto model datasets. <br>
This model assumes that all data points are generated from a mix of Gaussian distributions with unknown parameters. <br>
GMM is defined with mean vectors $\mu$ and covariance matrices $\Sigma$ for each variable present in the data. <br><br>

GMM are mostly used for:
- density estimation,
- clustering.
